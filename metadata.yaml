description: Malthus published a variety of pamphlets and tracts on economics in which
  he approached the problem of what determines price. In this pamphlet, published
  in 1815, he states 'It may be laid down then as a general truth, that rents naturally
  rise as the difference between the price of produce and the cost of the instruments
  of production increases'.
